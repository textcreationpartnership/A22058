            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For from the very higheſt myſteries in the Godhead, and the moſt inſcrutable Councels in the Trinitie, to the very loweſt pit of Hell, and the confuſed actions of the diuels there, there is nothing now vnſearched into by the curioſitie of mens braines; Men not being contented with the knowledge of ſo much of the Will of God, as it hath pleaſed him to reueale; but they will needs ſit with him in his moſt priuie Cloſet, and become priuie of his moſt inſcrutable Councels: And therefore it is no wonder, that men in theſe our dayes doe not ſpare to wade in all the deepeſt myſteries that belong to the perſons or State of Kings or Princes, that are gods vpon Earth: ſince we ſee, (as we haue already ſaid) that they ſpare not God himſelfe. And this licence that euery talker or writer now aſſumeth to himſelfe, is come to this abuſe, that many <hi>Phormio's</hi> will giue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to <hi>Hanibal,</hi> and many men that neuer went out of the compaſſe of Cloiſters or Colledges, will freely wade by their writings in the deepeſt myſteries of Monarchie and politique gouernment: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it cannot otherwiſe fall out, but that when men goe out of their element, and meddle with things aboue their capacitie; themſelues ſhall not onely goe aſtray, and ſtumble in darkneſſe, but will miſlead alſo diuers others with themſelues into many miſtakings and errours; The proofe whereof wee haue lately had by a Booke written by Doctour <hi>Cowell,</hi> called <hi>THE INTERPRETER:</hi> For hee being onely a <hi>Ciuilian</hi> by profeſſion, and vpon that large ground of a kinde of Dictionary (as it were) folowing the Alphabet, hauing all kind of purpoſes belonging to Gouernment and Monarchie in his way, by medling in matters aboue his reach, he hath fallen in many things to miſtake and deceiue himſelfe: In ſome things diſputing ſo nicely vpon the Myſteries of this our Monarchie, that it may receiue doubtfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations: yea in ſome poynts very derogatory to the ſupreme power of this Crowne: In other caſes miſtaking the true ſtate of the Parliament of this Kingdome, and the fundamentall Conſtitutions and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges thereof: And in ſome other points ſpeaking vnreuerently of the Common Law of England, and of the works of ſome of the moſt famous and ancient Iudges therein; it being a thing vtterly vnlawfull to any Subiect, to ſpeake or write againſt that lawe vnder which he liueth, and which we are ſworne and are reſolued to maintaine. Wherefore, vpon iuſt conſiderations mouing vs hereunto, for preuenting of the ſayd errors and inconueniences in all times to come, We doe hereby not onely prohibite the buying-vttering or reading of the ſayd Books, but doe alſo will and ſtraitly commaund all and ſingular perſons whatſoeuer, who haue or ſhall haue any of them in their hands or cuſtody, That vpon paine of our high diſpleaſure, and the conſequence thereof, they doe deliuer the ſame preſently vpon this publication, to the Lord Maior of London, if they or any of them be dwelling in or neere the ſayd Citie, or otherwiſe to the Sheriffe of the County where they or any of them ſhall reſide, and in the two Vniuerſities to the Chancellor or Vicechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor there, to the intent that further order may be giuen for the vtter ſuppreſſing thereof. And becauſe there ſhall be better ouerſight of Books of all ſorts before they come to the Preſſe, we haue reſolued to make choice of Commiſſioners that ſhall looke more narrowly into the nature of all thoſe things that ſhall be put to the Preſſe, either concerning our Authoritie Royall, or concerning our gouernment or the Lawes of our Kingdome, from whom a more ſtrict account ſhalbe yeelded vnto vs, then hath bene vſed heretofore.</p>
